        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          For this project, our goal was to create a deep learning model that learn to identify 10 native plants in Washington State.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="sectioncard">
        <h2> First Attempt to Get Data </h2>
        <p>
          Our first attempt was to get herbarium specimen data from the University of Washington. We wanted to use Herbarium records since they are standarized with good labels that make deep learning possible. Unfortunately, this didn't work out as the database housing the records was down. Although we couldn't use herbarium records, we decided to still pursue a similar approach.
        </p>
        <h2> Successful Attempt to Get Data </h2>
        <p>
          Our second attempt was to pivot from herbarium specimen data to images of live plants, taken by citizen scientists on the app iNaturalist. This was more risky since not all of the images are verified with their labeling. We were able to get enough quality data however, with looking at just 10 plants. 
        </p>
        <h2> Preprocessing the Data</h2>
        <p>
          We then had to download our data and get it into folders for each species, which we could then load into a tensorflow dataset with each folder as the classes. We standarized the image sizes as well. One advantage of the non herbarium images is we didn't have to filter out physical labels included in the images. 
        </p>
        <h2> Building a Model</h2>
        <p>
          We then built a model trying different layers of mostly convolutional layers and linear layers, but we also tested to see what layers would help reduce overfit like batch normalization.
        </p>
        <h2> Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          We were surprised by how well the model was able to generalize its learning. It performed especially well on certain species, which makes us curious about how it would perform if trained on more species and more data.
        </p>
