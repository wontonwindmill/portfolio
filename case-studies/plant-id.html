    <h2>Development Project</h2>
    <p>In this project, I am completing a competitive analysis on three websites with a favoriting function and then using that information to make my own website with a favoriting function.</p>

    <h4>Summary Paragraph:</h4>
    <p>
      All three websites were reasonably well done, with different strengths and weaknesses that influence users. For Nike, the site doesn't allow favoriting while browsing, only after clicking on a product card and also in the cart. This seems like it would encourage users to focus more on finding an individual product they like and navigating to it, rather than saving multiple for later while browsing. Nike also displays content in categories like based off of sport on the homepage, without considering the user's favorite content. To me, this creates a design that funnels users towards products that they already know they want. This makes sense for encouraging users to quickly find the product they want and buy it. The favoriting function seems to be a backup if users have second thoughts, allowing them to put the item they like away to buy later, in either the product page or the cart page. In Nike's case, favoriting seems to be more of a “buy later” function, meant to not interfere with the primary buying experience. Curiously, they do have recommendations in the favorites page, maybe because if a user has already favorite items, they are more suited than the regular user to browse and see further recommendations. For the Washington Trails Association (WTA), favoriting is available nearly everywhere you can see a hike's information. There are also good suggestions on the favorite's page. This seems to encourage users to browse many hikes, and favorite lots that look good. WTA also has tags on the posts that make it even easier to scan and find relevant posts. Pinterest also seems to do browsing well, with favorite's page having pretty limited functionality mostly acting as a history. Instead, the favorites are used to improve the main page, which recommends off of favorited items. Pinterest also allows lots of favoriting, so it is encouraged and an important part of the main feed experience.

    <h4>Theme:</h4>
    <p>My theme I’m choosing to make my website on is posts about fishing spots/seasons in Washington State. For filtering, I will have a main page of different posts that you can filter by species of fish and what season it is. For sort I will do it by date posted. I will accomplish this by maintaining a list of objects of my fishing posts, and I can filter and sort this list before I map it to react components. </p>
    <h4>Factors to implement:</h4>
    <p>Honestly, I thought every feature in the Competitive Comparison Chart worked well, when implemented by their respective companies. However, I will focus on these three.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I think the most important thing for me is being able to favorite content on whatever page you are in, especially while browsing. I would implement this by having a favorite button wherever content is displayed.</li>
      <li>Second most important is filtering and sorting not only in the main posts but also in the favorites section, which I will implement with drop down menus.
      </li>
      <li>After that is utilizing tags in posts to make the posts easier to scan for useful information.
      </li>
    </ol>
