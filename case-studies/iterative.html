        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          The goal of this project is to practice following the iterative design process in solving a design problem. In
          this project,
          we worked with Aster, a startup that seeks to improve women's health practices. Pregnant individuals face
          challenges in managing healthcare documentation for prenatal and postpartum care, leading to incomplete or
          delayed submissions to the provider. In this project, Aster seeks a cohesive, user-friendly digital solution
          to
          streamline this process and improve care efficiency. We collaborated with Aster to create a hi-fi prototype of
          a
          mobile app that establishes an easy-to-use interface for pregnant individuals to efficiently complete
          healthcare
          forms.

        <h2> Initial Sketches </h2>
        <p>
          An initial part of the iterative design process involved drafting up sketches for potential designs. Each one
          of us individually
          brainstormed two distinctly different flows for the mobile app. We had a variety of ideas!

    <h2> Our Design </h2>
    <p>We went through many different iterations of our design for Aster Health. Considering the emphasis on innovative design for form completion and collecting information, most of our sketches are experimental ways of thinking about playful design. </p>
    <p class="question">
      What design decisions led us to our final design?
    </p>
    <p>As you can see in some of our sketches, our first iteration of designs often focus on adding functionality or flair to a simple integrated form completion process. After encouragement from Talie, we also thought about more "crazy" ways to achieve our goals, including integrating games surrounding form completion and bringing in a factor of competition and urgency. We also explored the route of making a mascot for the app, the idea being that an animal mascot might endear the user and make them feel more comfortable.  </p>
    <p class="question">
      How did we update our design based on our peer's critiques?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the peer critiques, we received positive feedback about the risks we took in making novel designs to engage the user, like our gamification and our mascot. However, we also received constructive feedback that our padding and alignment often needed to be touched up. Also, we also received feedback that our notification messages and affirmation messages being capitalized was jarring especially when talking about sensitive subjects like a baby inside a patient's body. We adjusted accordingly by fixing our padding and capitalization. We also received feedback from our client that in stressful times, expecting mothers would not want games or a mascot necessarily, so we decided to focus on our other features like our progress bars, chatbot, and notifications in the hifi prototype. We also listened to feedback about our affirmation messages taking a smaller role by making them a popup rather than a new page.
    </p>
    <p class="question">
      What parts did we keep from different sketches and why?
    </p>
    <p>After feedback from our partners at Aster Health, it became clear that users going through a pregnancy, both an emotional and difficult time, would prioritize efficient and clear design over playful engagement features. We therefore decided to keep only the most sober and efficient features we had sketched, such as the modular presentation of our forms, including a process bar and indications of how many minutes are left. We also kept the feature of notifications that enable our users to answer directly in the notifications tab, similar to a WhatsApp notifications (with a press and hold, type answer in notification feature). Another feature we kept were the possibility to put in information through voice notes and uploading forms. Both of these option should make form submission and information collection more accessible our users and save time and energy. Finally, some of the chat components from our initial sketches were considered when our collaborators suggested incorporating a conversational way of filling the forms. We got very positive feedback for those features from both peers and Aster, which is why they are included. </p>

Blue: <br>
<i>We chose blue to create a sense of lightness and tranquility for the user. Blue is also a highly accessible color and we used differing shades of blue and a gradient in order to establish visual hierarchy. </i>
<br><br>
White: <br>
<i>We use white to create accents against the blue</i>
<br><br>
Font color: dark green <br>
<i>We use the classic aster font color that also contrasts against the light blue on the screen.  </i>
<br><br>
Font: Lato <br>
<i>We used Leto as a san serif font is rounded and has class proportions that create a sense of harmony. This is also very similar to the font Aster had initially used so we wanted to create harmony with their current designs.  </i>
<br><br>
Buttons: <br>
<i>Our buttons are long, rounded, dark blue and cover the screen for easy accessibility. </i>
<br><br>
Nav Bar: <br>
<i>Nav Bar is pink in order to be visible and create contrast against the dark blue gradient.  </i>
<br><br>
Incomplete forms: <br>
<i>All incomplete forms appear as red to make it clear to the user what is incomplete. </i>
<br><br>
Aster assistant icons: <br>
<i>We put icons of notifications and call on the top right corner in white to lead the user to look towards this option. In the chat button we also add a voice note icon in a lighter circle with a blue microphone to attract the eye towards it </i>

    </p>
    <p class="question">
      How our designs lead to the intended impact?
    </p>
    <p>Our design leads to the intended impact because we prioritized features that communicate transparency, encouragement and efficiency. </p>

    <h2> Takeaways </h2>
    <p>
      Our client, Aster, highlighted several positive features and key takeaways from our final prototype. Fifi, the
      founder, expressed her appreciation for our swift adjustment following her initial feedback.

    </p>
    <h2> Features they will implement </h2>
    <p>
      <li> Aster Assitant: we integrated a chatbot named Aster Assistant, which allows users to interact via chat,
        calls, or voice messages to complete forms. Fifi remarked that we effectively made Aster feel like a "warm
        entity" and succeeded in humanizing the company </li>
      <li> Time-Left Feature: aims to display how much time a user has remaining, helping to alleviate feelings of
        overwhelm by showing limits on task duration. This had not been previously considered by the company!</li>
      <li> Scan Feature: scan feature targets both patients and healthcare providers, enabling them to scan existing
        forms and avoid redundant tasks.This had not been considered previously. </li>
      <li>Lock screen question completion </li>
      <li> Simple and straightforward design </li>
      <li> Accessible color palette </li>

    <h2> Things to improve </h2>
    <p>

      <li> The affirmations page, though in good faith, may be patrionising and waste user’s time.</li>
      <li> Restructuring the information architecture on the checklist page in order to prevent a user being overwhelmed
      </li>
      <li> Adding shared features for instance a shared signature or shared information across forms
      </li>
    </p>

    <h2> What did we learn? </h2>

    <p>This was our team’s first attempt at prototyping and thus our final deliverable was not up to par. We would like
      to improve our autolayering and information architecture to modify our design from medium-level fidelity to high
      fidelity.
      We also recognised that design features should be out of the box! While we were hesitant to add the gamification
      feature initially we are glad we did because it helped us pivot to other unique ideas such as timers and scanning.
      We recognise not all unique features will be well-recieved but we were encouraged to think broad!
