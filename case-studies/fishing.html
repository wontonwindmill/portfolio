        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>
          For this project, my goal was to create a resource for fishing in Washington State. The basic design I relied on was cards with filtering, sorting, and a favoriting function. However, to figure out my exact implementation I looked at other popular websites for inspiration.

        <h2> Competitive Analysis </h2>
        <p>
          I analyzed Nike, Pinterest, and Washington Trails Association (WTA) to see how they presented information and implemented their favoriting function. Below is a competitive analysis comparison table with the results:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>-</th>
            <th>Nike</th>
            <th>Washington Trails Association</th>
            <th>Pinterest</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Suggests more items on favorite's page</td>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>o</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Favoriting while browsing</td>
            <td>o</td>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>x</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Filtering in favorite's page </td>
            <td>o</td>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>x</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Home page recommends content based on favorites/prior activity</td>
            <td>o</td>
            <td>o</td>
            <td>x</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Home feed groups content by categories</td>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>o</td>
            <td>o</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Tags in posts</td>
            <td>o</td>
            <td>x</td>
            <td>o</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>
          Nike was interesting in that it did not allow favoriting while browsing, only inside cards and actually inside the shopping cart. I wasn't sure if this would work for my site, since browsing would be the main functionality. Instead, Washington Trails Association and Pinterest seemed to have better approaches. WTA made it a point to make favoriting allowed everywhere a card was displayed, and Pinterest too. WTA also had nice tags on posts making it easier to browse and quickly decide if you wanted to save it. I decided to pull this forward into my design.

    <h2> Final Design</h2>
    <p>For my actual design, the first thing I thought about was the title. I tried a header but it just didn't sit right after playing around with it. Instead, just using large text and utilizing white space made my title pop nicely. I went for a culturally significant phrase of “Gone Fishing?” and added smaller text to specify the location of Washington State. I put a small description to inform visitors and hopefully to get them excited about what the site has to offer. The site itself I originally tried two different sized columns, but even sized columns ended up making more sense because I could reuse the cards and it was easier to keep it responsive by collapsing them into one column that can toggle between two. I added in the useful tags as inspired by WTA and filtering and sorting which was common with Nike, WTA, and Pinterest. It took a little added effort to get everything working with conditional rendering of React components and passing all the relevant data and handler functions, but the website came together well in the end.  </p>
